# Microverse-tic-tac-toe

This is a two-player tic-tac-toe game built with Ruby that is played using the terminal/command prompt.

To run the game, you must have Ruby installed. Run 'ruby bin/tictactoe.rb' from within the main folder.

To play, each player will type the coordinates of the square in which they wish to place their mark. The squares are identified as follows:

      a1|a2|a3
      b1|b2|b3
      c1|c2|c3

To win, a player must own all the squares in a row, column, or diagonal. If no player has won when all squares are full, the game is a draw.

A player may quit the game at any time by typing 'quit' instead of entering a square.
